For this project, the design choices were made to ensure a clean, modern, and user-friendly experience across both desktop and mobile devices. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key design decisions:

Responsive Layout: The design was built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal display across various screen sizes. Media queries were implemented to adapt the layout for both mobile and desktop views, adjusting the navigation, brand positioning, and other elements accordingly.

Typography:

The brand name uses a cursive font ("Great Vibes") to give a sophisticated and elegant feel, aligning with the chic and stylish nature of the store.
The navigation links use a sans-serif font ("Raleway") for readability and a modern look.
Color Scheme: The color scheme revolves around soft pastel tones, primarily featuring a light pink palette, which conveys a feminine and welcoming vibe. The color choices are easy on the eyes and enhance the overall elegant feel of the website.

Offcanvas Navigation:

A hidden offcanvas menu was used for mobile responsiveness, allowing users to access the main navigation without cluttering the page layout. The offcanvas was positioned on the right, but it could be switched to the left for consistency with different pages.
The toggle button (hamburger icon) is clean and intuitive, appearing on smaller screens to ensure easy navigation.
Brand Centering and Header Layout: On mobile, the brand name is centered for a more balanced appearance, while the logo remains fixed in place. The header layout was designed to provide easy access to navigation and key actions (sign-in, sign-up, or shopping cart).

Cart Page Design:

The cart page features a clear display of the user's selected items, with options to update quantities or remove items. Each section is clearly separated, and call-to-action buttons (like "Checkout") are prominently placed.
The cart maintains the same minimalist, chic aesthetic of the rest of the site to ensure visual consistency.
Overall, the design choices focused on creating an intuitive, seamless experience for users while maintaining the brand's identity as a modern, stylish, and approachable online store.
